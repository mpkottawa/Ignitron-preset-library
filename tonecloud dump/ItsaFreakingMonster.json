    "Description": "My Nuno tone trying to match early Nuno with ADAMP1 and some boost. Using  5153 and I tame the stupid mid range honk in every amp by using the reverb , check it out.  I used a spectral analysis for just a  guitar track then  mixed and matched until I found a matching tone graphically and by ear, finally got rid of the nasally midrange by using the reverb tone and it works!  New update:10/11/14 I wanted to make it very responsive, this has a good amount of gain, basically the harder you hit the strings, the more it opens up, combine it with the volume to get even more control. And I like to keep it simple, 5153 and reverb that's it. I just use the reverb for tone and little fx. ",
